/* Explain javascript callbacks: what are they, why are they useful, and how do you use them?
    * A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed.
    * Callbacks are useful because they allow us to write better asynchronous code.
    * Callbacks are used in situations such as:
    * - Making http requests
    * - Reading files
    * - Waiting for user input
    * - Waiting for events to occur
    * - Calling functions after another function has finished
    * - etc.
*/

/* Callbacks exercise:
    * Modify the previous exercise to use callbacks.
    * The callback should be called after the average mark has been calculated.
    * The callback should receive the average mark as a parameter.
    * The callback should show the average mark.
